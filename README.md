This repository contains a small single-page Valentine landing you can customize.

Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
2. Or run a simple static server (Node required):

```bash
# install a small static server (one-time)
npx serve .
# or
npx http-server .
```

Deploy to Vercel

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel` (or use the web dashboard)
2. From the project root run:

```bash
vercel
```

Choose the defaults (this is a static site). Vercel will auto-deploy and provide a URL.

Next steps
- Replace gallery placeholders with your photos (put images in a folder like `public/images`).
- Hook up a real RSVP endpoint or use a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.
